                        A project I'm working on for my Capstone project. A multiplayer turn based strategy game where two players can choose a team of units them do battle on a grid.
                        It has taught me a ton on a lot of skills, with the main one being Unity multiplayer and research as a whole. At the time that I made this, Unity 6 multiplayer was
                        incredibly new, and had nearly no good resources for learning. This project was great practice for when I need to learn something new and have no easy way to do so.

                        A VR puzzle game with an arcade cabinet that affects the world around you, and vice versa. My first big project with a company, even though it was a small company.
                        It gave me quite a bit of experience with Unity VR, and the processes that go into it working correctly. Also gave me experience with a team, and the challenges that
                        come with trying to coordinate it.

                        It was a nice chance for me to practice my HTML. It also introduced my to some JS, though not enough to make me confident in it.

                        A fast-paced 2D platformer where you play as Dr. Güber, a genius, and slightly mad, scientist attempting to escape a nuclear reactor in meltdown. Inspired by pizza tower
                        and Wario Land, you have 5 minutes to escape. This was done for a 24-hour Neumont Game Jam, and was a good lesson in time management. I practiced my pixel art for this one,
                        making Dr. Güber and a little of the terrain.

                        A small sequel to 5 Minutes Til' Meltdown inspired by Super Mario 64. Also done for a 24-hour Neumont Game Jam, we attempted to make a game with fun interesting movement as 
                        you ran from a mutated form of your father. While it didn't turn out exactly as we wanted it to, I'm still putting it on here because it served as a great practice experience. 
                        It provided a wake up call when it came to proper time management and music composition, as well as practice with lighting and level design (even though it didn't make it into
                        the final game).
